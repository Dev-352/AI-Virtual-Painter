# AI-Virtual-Painter
Python project that tracks hand position in real-time and draws on screen using the index finger.
I utilized the mediapipe and OpenCV libraries to implement real-time hand tracking and enable drawing on the screen with the index finger.

Use your index and middle finger to activate Selection Mode and choose from various colors or the eraser at the top of the screen.

Adjust the thickness of the draw using the distance between your thumb and index finger, selecting the desired size when the pinky finger is up.

Clear the screen simply by closing your hand.

Enter in Stand by Mode using only your index and pinky finger (indicated by a line between these 2 fingers). This mode is useful when you want to draw separate things on the screen.
